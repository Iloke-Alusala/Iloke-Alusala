- 👋 Hi, I’m @Iloke-Alusala
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and electronics. I like to programme in different languages, but my favourite ones are Python and C++.
- 🌱 I’m still in highschool so I'm still learning everything. Although after school I'd like to major in some field related to...
      You guessed right, programming and electronics
